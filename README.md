Battleship
==========

A simple implementation of the game Battleship

# Objective:

## Reason about 2-dimensional arrays, understand how to use indices to access elements in a 2-dimensional array, and apply 2-dimensional arrays to implement a fully-functioning game.

You will be implementing the classic board game Battleship. Battleship is played between two players. Each has a 10×10 grid, and has ships of various sizes placed in his or her grid, hidden from the other player. Players take turns guessing locations on the opponent’s grid; the opponent declares if a guess is a MISS or a HIT depending on if there is a ship at that location. The game is over when one player has destroyed all of his or her opponent’s ships!

We will be implementing the game a bit differently than the board game – ships will be randomly placed on the board for each player, and players will only get notice on HITS and if he or she wins the game, instead of when each individual ship is destroyed.

You will be working with an incomplete Battleship class. You will need to implement 9 methods correctly to complete the lab and get full credit. Don’t worry, the methods are short and many are very similar to each other! There are lots of hints in the code comments to help you.

You only need to implement the code in the incomplete methods, where it says YOUR CODE GOES HERE. You may look at the other code to understand the program, but **do not change any other code in the program! You will not get credit for the lab if you change the existing code!**
